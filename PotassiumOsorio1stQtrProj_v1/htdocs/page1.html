					<h2 id="tradi">Traditional Mediums</h2>
					<p>Besides digital art, I also do traditional...well, everyone always starts out with a piece of paper and a pencil, but if I want to do something quickly with less the effort, I always go for the Iconic tradiitonal paper and pencil. I use this medium whenever i plan out designs for characters i will be using in my art pieces like this one, this is a reference sheet for one of my characters named Michaela. I also use paints and other materials for more detailed artowkrs but the tools I always have with me are pens, pencils, and paper.</p>

					<h2 id="animal">Creatures</h2>
					<p>And if humans aren't my thing for the day, I spend it drawing cute or very grotesque creatures of any size. The photo above is what I think of if I drew a hybrid of my character and a long furby, I call this creature "The Furvik" which is a combination of Furby and my character's name, Viktor. This was actually a redraw of a redraw of my friend's drawing of "Furvik" that he did for fun, so I thought that I should draw it too, so now this image is etched into your memory, thank you.</p>

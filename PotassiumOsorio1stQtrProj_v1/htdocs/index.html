		<h2>Description:</h2>
		<p>Project Gallery Walk is a website that details my art journey, the arts that have gained many likes over the years, and what phases I've gone through to reach my current artstyle. This website would also showcase what styles i can do and what i tend to avoid drawing due to personal preferences.</p>
		<p>A quote i always like to say to mysef is "Anyone is born an artist, it's your choice whether or not to keep pursuing it" which keeps me motivated. The image above has gathered a total of 156 likes on amino and had made it's way to the feature page. One of my most popular artworks of this year. It ws drawn close to the end of pride month so many bits of it look rushed like the background. Most of the images i will be showing from the above example until the last are form a fandom called "CountryHumans".</p>

		<h2>Soft colors test</h2>
		<p>This artpiece meanwhile is one of my experiments when it comes to monotone-like colors, for this I used the color pink because it looked soft. Back then I usually went for more dark toned or highly saturated colors when it comes to coloring but this time I thought "what if i chose softer colors" and so I began to implement more softer colors for some art pieces if I ever need it for more aesthetic uses, they were more calming to the eyes but getting the right color is sometimes difficult.</p>

		<h2>Glow art</h2>
		<p>One word that can describe the lighting is "harsh". A drawing from my phone from before, this was one of my other test drawings, this one was for glow art. Glow art is one of my favorite ways of adding extra details, which explains the dark tones and over saturated colors mentions from earlier. It took many failed tries to transfer this style over to my laptop since some features of Ibis paint are not common enough that other prograns compatible with laptops adopt them but in the end, all these attempts have made them worth it to see how much i've improved.</p>

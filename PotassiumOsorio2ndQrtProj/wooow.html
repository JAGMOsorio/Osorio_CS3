					<p> If I had the choice to visit my past self, I'd take it, because in the future i know she would need the reassurance that I would grow up alright, that we'd grow up alright, that we won't end it too soon. I wan't to grow into a person that someone with my struggles would look up to and see inspiration in, even if it's only with one artwork at a time. I've presented this rough sketch because not every project can be completed, not everything can go well, and not everyone has the heart to get through the hard part of the progress, and that's alright because it means you can learn from where you've stopped and continue with something new.</p>

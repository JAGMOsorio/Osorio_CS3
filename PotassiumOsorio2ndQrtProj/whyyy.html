				<h2 id="swoosh">Event arts</h2>
					<p>If events exist, so do themed arts! Like the pride month art, this one has been specifically made for the christmas holidays, combining aspects of "meme culture" and "holiday spirit" into a half-effort, very rushed, very rough artpiece to a holiday that has been combined with my birthday so many times, resulting to double presents and majority of people forgetting it's actually my birthday a week or two before-</p>

				<h2 id="dead">Arts club</h2>
					<p>With countless of schoolworks piled up, it was a good decision that i joined a club that had my interest, SINAG has really helped me push through my limits with the given prompts and improved my confidence as well for the weekly art prompt presentations. For the 3rd week of November, I've made an artpiece for dias de los muertos (day of the dead), one of my most tedious pieces yet, consisting of many many layers but in the end it was worth it to see the reactions of my peers, which i can say were all positive!</p>
